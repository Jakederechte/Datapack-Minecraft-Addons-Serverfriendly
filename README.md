# Datapack-Minecraft-Addons-(Serverfriendly)
This Pack combines many useful Tools for Minecraft, which can all be turned on and off separately.

At the Moment there are these three Tools:
-Tree Excavation: Adds an Axe with which you can chop down entire Trees at once.
-Ore Excavation: Adds a Pickaxe that allows you to mine entire veins of Ore at once.
-Hand Furnace: Adds a Furnace that when offhand will melt your Ores and Food in the background

At the moment we are still working on a Resourcepack for this Pack and on a 4th Tool

If you have any suggestions for Tools that are not too strong and need to be added to Minecraft, please post them in the Ideas Channel in the Discussions section.

All other Informations can be found in the Information Book, that you get at the Beginning, or when you change the Settings. To do this, use the "/reload" command.
